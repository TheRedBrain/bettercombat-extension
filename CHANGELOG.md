# 1.1.1

- poses of two-handed weapons are now correctly displayed

# 1.1.0

- 'Stamina Attributes' is no longer a required dependency
- attack stamina_cost can now be a fractional value
- added global multipliers to attack stamina costs, one for attacks that are feinted, one for attacks that are actually executed. These multipliers can be set in the server config.

- fixed crash when attack damage_type field is not a valid damage type identifier
